## Course Project
The "Touch Type Workout" is a standalone Python application meant to develop and test “touch typing” skills with English 
keyboard focusing on extreme age (kids and/or seniors).

Typing without looking on keyboard is enabled by muscle memory, which is also sometimes called procedural memory, and is involved 
with learning and mastering motor skills. To gain this skill human needs to spent 10-15 hours on practicing and Touch Typing Workout 
will be an awesome tool for this. It will allow user reach 40 words per minute typing speed.
The research of existing tools shows that there are no products focusing on people who are too yang or too old and this audience often 
have the needs to practice Touch Typing as well. 

Addressing needs of this audience means that we have to build application with 
specific features:
 UI should be nice, simple and very well readable.
 We need to collect (and display) statistics of user performance using 3 features: typing speed, errors rate and typing rhythm.
 Based on statistics application will provide recommendation on what to improve when practiced.

Touch Typing Workout will have two core parts: practice (lessons and tests) and statistics (performance measure and 
recommendations). After each lesson or test user will be able to observe the progress of a study: graphs for typing speed, 
errors rate and typing rhythm, and text recommendations for improving results
